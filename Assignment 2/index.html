            According to our most recent assessment of scientific data, foods containing gluten levels not exceeding 20 PPM would not pose a health risk to the vast majority of individuals with Celiac Disease or to individuals with gluten sensitivity. The level of gluten found in our pizza made with Gluten Free Crust is below 20 PPM. However, Domino's pizza made with a Gluten Free Crust is prepared in a common kitchen with the risk of gluten exposure. Therefore, Domino's DOES NOT recommend this pizza for customers with Celiac Disease. Customers with gluten sensitivities should exercise judgement in consuming this pizza. <br> <br> Copyright © Pizza Hub 2023</p>
